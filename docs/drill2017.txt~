ICSTool will be available during the October 21 drill.

ICSTool is a WEB based tool to help 
with the operation of EmPrep's Incident Command System (ICS)
and
will be used in parallel with the standard EmPrep procedures of the ICS. 
The parallel use in this case means 
that ICS activities will be duplicated when possible
in the ICSTool after any normal EmPrep action,
e.g., sign-ins, communications, team assignments, etc.

The goal of this ICSTool exercise is to:
(1) get ICS participants familiar with the ICSTool,
(2) uncover deficencies in the ICSTool methods and approaches,
(3) test an alternative neighborhood-LAN/Internet configuration,

The ICSTool may accessed 
through a WEB browser 
on smart-phones, tablets, or computers.
The URL is: http://icstool2.tupl.us 
with login/password: emprep/user101
You may access the URL via your normal internet or cellular-network connection,
or at the Command Center by connecting 
to a router (no password) with the ID 'emprep2'.

You can try out the ICSTool now to become famaliar with its operation.
In the ICSTool there are online 'help' links to explain 
in detail the different features of the system.
Any user input data input before the drill 
will be erased just prior to the drill.

You can contact me anytime if you have questions.
