Hello Khin, BDPNN members

I have developed a WEB based tool (ICSTool) that may help neighborhood CERT groups 
get organized and operate an Incident Command System during disasters.
Having tested it in a limited way in our neighborhood, Northside-EmPrep Neighborhood, 
I think it could be useful in alleviating some of the difficulties in organizing a CERT group and in running the Incident Command System.

It is by no means a polished WEB program, but in its current form it can demonstrate some of its more useful features.  More documentation is available once you Sign-In and are at the User Action Menu under the link “ICSTool Info”.  Some of the content is specific to the Northside-EmPrep Neighborhood. However, the ICSTool can be easily adapted to other neighborhood groups.

The ICSTool is by no means complete or comprehensive. 
Certainly there are desirable features that are not implemented and some implemented features that do not work very well.  
So, now it would be good to get more people involved with the ICSTool in the form of comments, advice, 
and collaboration.


A public version of the ICSTool is available at:
